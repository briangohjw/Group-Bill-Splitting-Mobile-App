# Group-Bill-Splitting-Mobile-App
A prototype of a group bill splitting mobile application, created with Justinmind. Emerged champions in the SMUX-PayPal challenge

## Features (Proof of Concept)
#### 1. Automatic Bill Splitting
Recalculation of cost per pax immediately triggered upon changes in group structure e.g. when a member leaves/is removed

#### 2. Payment Rebalancing
In-built algorithm that ensures subscription amount evenly split among members over time, even if short-term issues arise e.g. member has insufficient funds

#### 3. Variety of Plan Options
Pre-set plans are quick and fuss-free while custom plans allow for greater control

#### 4. Activity Tracker
Leader has bird’s-eye view of members’ activities. Members can track spending and receive payment notifications

#### 5. Easy Management
Option to add/remove members and change the Group Leader

## How to Run
Open index.html with Internet Explorer (as Justinmind no longer opens on Google Chrome / Microsoft Edge).
